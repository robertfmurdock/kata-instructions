Our developers regularly do Katas to hone their skills and create more concise and simple solutions. Please use a Github or Bitbucket repository with frequent commits so that we may see into your unique brand of problem-solving. Do not feel obligated to complete the entire Kata, but please complete at least about half, and up to as much as you're able.
